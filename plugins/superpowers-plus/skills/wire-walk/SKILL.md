description: Use when about to claim a feature is end-to-end shipped, done, complete, working, or reachable — especially after a backend/command/API lands, before marking a PR ready, and at the end of build-robust-features or subagent-driven-development. Use when wiring spans more than one component, phase, or agent.

# Wire-Walk

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC 2119] [RFC 8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Overview

A feature is not shipped when its code compiles, its tests pass, and CI is green. It is shipped when a real consumer can reach it. The recurring defect is a **backend that exists, is correct, is CI-green, and is connected to nothing a user can touch** — the seam between components is nobody's component, so nobody wires it.

Wire-walk is the hard gate that catches this. The principle: **building correctly across a seam is unreliable; auditing reachability is reliable.** You convert an unreliable generative claim ("it's all wired up") into a reliable verification ("here is each hop, proven connected, or here is the exact break").

This is a **discipline gate**, not advice. If **any operator-supplied flow** is broken, the feature is not shipped — it is partially-wired, which is a defect. The runner MUST NOT re-rank a flow as "secondary" or "edge case" to pass.

## When to Use

The runner MUST run wire-walk **before** any of these: claiming a feature is "done / shipped / end-to-end / complete / working"; marking a PR ready; closing a feature issue; the final step of `build-robust-features`; the final review of `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`. This applies especially when the wiring crosses a component, a phase, an agent, or a release.

## The Iron Law

**The operator defines the flows. You only get to trace them.**

The runner MUST NOT generate the flow list itself and audit against it. An agent's self-generated flows are the flows it already wired — they pass, the blind spot survives, the gate becomes theater. The flow the agent forgot to list is the one most likely to be broken.

## Procedure

### 1. Elicit the flows — GREENFIELD, no draft

Ask the operator, cold, for the key user flows. The runner MUST NOT propose a draft list first, MUST NOT suggest examples, and MUST NOT frame the question with its own component model. Anchoring the operator with your guess launders your own blind spots into the "ground truth." Like open-ended adversarial review, the value is in what they surface that you did not expect.

Ask plainly:

> "Before I can call this done, list the key things a user actually does with this feature — short, defined task statements (e.g. 'connect a UV-Pro', 'send a message', 'change a channel'). I'll trace each one to code and prove it's wired."

**Pin the starting state for each flow.** A flow that passes against a populated dev environment can dead-end on a real first run — the identity transmit bug was exactly this: "send a message" worked with an identity already in the store and dead-ended on a fresh install where setup never created one. So each flow MUST be traced from a real consumer's actual starting state, and the runner MUST include the cold-start states explicitly: **fresh install, first launch, empty store, and post-upgrade.** The **setup / onboarding / first-run flow is itself a REQUIRED flow to trace** — the "setup writes the state that use reads" seam is the highest-risk seam in any feature, and it is invisible if you trace use-flows against pre-seeded state.

The runner MUST record the elicited flows (in the plan, PR, or issue) so "did you run wire-walk, against which flows" is checkable, not merely asserted. If the flows were captured at feature start as the definition-of-done, use those verbatim instead of re-asking.

**Autonomous / headless / subagent runs with no operator and no recorded flows: the runner MUST STOP and escalate.** Do not self-generate flows and pass yourself. A wire-walk with agent-authored flows is not a wire-walk.

### 2. Trace each flow as a touchpoint chain

For each operator flow, trace the **full chain**, every hop with `file:line`:

```
entry point  →  handler  →  IPC/command/call  →  backend fn  →  effect  →  return path
(UI control /
 CLI flag /
 API route /
 public fn)
```

Trace the flow **verbatim as the operator stated it**, and **from the flow's starting state** (§1). The runner MUST NOT narrow, merge, reinterpret, or substitute a flow to make it pass (see Red Flags).

**Trace gates backward to their producer.** When a hop is a precondition/gate (`active_identity()`, `is_connected`, `has_secret`, a required config field), do NOT stop at "something, somewhere, sets it." Trace the flow that *produces* that state **from this flow's starting state**, and confirm THAT flow is wired. The identity bug passed a naive forward trace because `set_active_identity` *had* a caller (the unlock UI) — but on a fresh install nothing produced an identity to unlock, so the gate was never satisfiable in the state the flow actually starts from. A precondition that is satisfiable "in principle" but not produced on the flow's real starting path is a ❌, not a ✅.

### 3. Verify each hop connects — hunt the break-patterns

These recur across every stack. Grep + read; no build needed.

| Break-pattern | Signature | How to find it |
|---|---|---|
| **Orphan producer** | Backend fn/command with zero **consumer** callers | grep its name, then confirm each hit is a real consumer invocation (the `invoke()` / call on the consumer's path) — NOT a registration, test, mock, comment, or re-export. A command "registered in lib.rs" with only registration + test hits is an orphan. Registration ≠ a caller. |
| **Dead control** | UI control rendered but no handler / no-op / handler never passed | read the control's props + its mount site |
| **Empty seam** | A prop/slot *designed* for the feature, passed `undefined`/nothing | grep the slot name at its mount site |
| **Missing variant** | A union/enum/type lacking the new option → can't select/declare it | read the type def vs. what the UI offers |
| **Unsatisfiable gate** | A precondition (`is_connected`, `active_identity`, `has_secret`) not *produced* on the flow's starting path | not "is anything calling the setter?" but "from this flow's starting state (fresh install etc.), does a wired setup flow actually produce it?" Satisfiable-in-principle ≠ produced-in-practice. |
| **Config-only path** | The only way to exercise it is hand-editing config/files | is there a consumer surface at all? |

### 4. Verdict per flow

State, per flow, with the exact break point:

- ✅ **wired** — every hop connects, traced `file:line` to `file:line`.
- ❌ **broken at `file:line`** — name the missing hop and which break-pattern.
- ⚠️ **wired but unverifiable here** — reserved for ONE case: every hop is traced and connected, and the only thing you cannot check is a physical/external **terminal effect** (on-air RF transmission, a live third-party service). It is NOT a bucket for "I couldn't trace this hop" or "I assume something sets it." **An untraceable, missing, or assumed hop is ❌, never ⚠️.** If you reach for ⚠️ because you couldn't follow the chain, that is a ❌.

### 5. Gate

If **any** operator-supplied flow is ❌, the feature is **NOT shipped**. The runner MUST NOT claim done, MUST NOT mark the PR ready, and MUST NOT close the issue. The remaining wiring is the real work, not a follow-up. Report the broken flows with their break points; that list is the spec for finishing the feature.

No outs:
- The runner MUST NOT **re-rank** a broken flow as "secondary / edge / not the primary use" to pass. Every operator flow counts equally; the operator supplied it because it matters.
- The runner MUST NOT **move a broken operator flow to "fast-follow / follow-up / polish"** so the current scope reads as done. Narrowing scope is the operator's call: a flow leaves the gate only when the **operator removes it** from the flow set, never when the agent reclassifies it.
- A ✅ on the other flows does not offset a ❌. One broken flow = not shipped.

## Red Flags — STOP

You are about to defeat the gate if you catch yourself:

- Writing the flow list yourself instead of asking the operator
- Proposing a "draft for you to confirm" (that is anchoring, not greenfield)
- Narrowing a flow ("the operator said 'connect a UV-Pro' but I'll trace the KISS path since that works")
- Counting "the backend command exists and is registered" as a wired flow (registration ≠ a caller)
- Counting "CI is green" or "tests pass" as reachability (they prove the hop, not the chain)
- Treating a ❌ as a follow-up / fast-follow / polish item so you can still say "done"
- Re-ranking a broken flow as "secondary / edge case" so the gate doesn't fire
- Tracing against a populated dev environment / seeded store instead of the flow's real starting state (fresh install, first launch, post-upgrade)
- Marking a hop ⚠️ "unverifiable" when you actually just couldn't trace it
- **"I'm confident it's wired, I don't need to ask for the flows / run this"** — that confidence is the exact failure mode. The identity epic was declared end-to-end with total confidence, from command-reachability, and shipped broken. Confidence is not evidence; run the gate.
- Running it autonomously with self-authored flows because no operator was available

All of these mean: you are grading your own homework. Stop. Get the operator's flows, or escalate.

## Common Mistakes

- **Tracing components, not flows.** "The IdentitySwitcher renders" is not a flow. "Configure my callsign, then transmit" is. Flows start from a user goal and cross whatever components they must.
- **Stopping at the first hop.** The break is usually mid-chain (the orphan backend, the empty seam), not at the control you can see.
- **Auditing only the happy path you built.** The motivating flow — the whole point of the feature — is the one to trace hardest, because it is the one most likely to have an unbuilt seam.
- **Verbal reassurance instead of `file:line`.** "It's all wired" is the claim under audit. Cite lines or it didn't happen.

## Why a hard gate (not advice)

This anti-pattern is too strong and consistent to be advisory — it has recurred across multiple features and agents despite a written "ship end-to-end" rule. Prose did not stop it. A gate that produces a per-flow ❌ with a break point, and forbids the "done" claim while one stands, is the enforcement the prose lacked. And because wire-walk is grep + read with no external service, it always runs — it cannot be deferred or skipped for quota/capacity the way an external reviewer can.
